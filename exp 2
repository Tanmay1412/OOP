Develop a program in C++ to create a database of studentâ€™s information system containing the 
following information: Name, Roll number, Class, Division, Date of Birth, Blood group, 
Contact address, Telephone number, Driving license no. and other. Construct the database with 
suitable member functions. Make use of constructor, default constructor, copy 
constructor, destructor, static member functions, friend class, this pointer, inline code and 
dynamic memory allocation operators-new and delete as well as exception handling.
