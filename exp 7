Write a program in C++ to use map associative container. The keys will be the names of states 
and the values will be the populations of the states. When the program runs, the user is 
prompted to type the name of a state. The program then looks in the map, using the state 
name as an index and returns the population of the state. 





#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Initialize a map to store country populations
    map<string, int> populationMap;

    // Adding countries and their populations (in millions)
    populationMap["China"] = 1339;
    populationMap["India"] = 1187;
    populationMap["US"] = 310;
    populationMap["Indonesia"] = 234;
    populationMap["Brazil"] = 193;

    // Display all countries and their populations
    cout << "Countries and their populations:\n";
    for (const auto& entry : populationMap) {
        cout << entry.first << ": " << entry.second << " million\n";
    }

    // Search for a specific country's population
    string country;
    cout << "\nEnter the name of the country to search: ";
    cin >> country;

    auto it = populationMap.find(country);
    if (it != populationMap.end()) {
        cout << country << "'s population is " << it->second << " million.\n";
    } else {
        cout << country << " not found in the map.\n";
    }

    // Erase a country from the map
    string countryToErase;
    cout << "\nEnter the name of the country to erase: ";
    cin >> countryToErase;

    if (populationMap.erase(countryToErase)) {
        cout << countryToErase << " has been removed from the map.\n";
    } else {
        cout << countryToErase << " not found in the map. No changes made.\n";
    }

    // Display the updated map
    cout << "\nUpdated list of countries and their populations:\n";
    for (const auto& entry : populationMap) {
        cout << entry.first << ": " << entry.second << " million\n";
    }

    return 0;
